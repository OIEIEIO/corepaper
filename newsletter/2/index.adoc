This is the second Core Paper Newsletter. This newsletter aims at
giving readers regular updates on Core Paper projects, including
Kulupu, Solri and others.

The newsletter will be updated from time to time, without a fixed
interval.

== Announcing "Kulupu, The Code"

To faciliate the difference between development and marketing, we're
going to launch a canary network (testnet), called *Kulupu, The Code*
(short for *The Code* in the below paragraphs). To avoid confusions,
the current mainnet is going to be called *Kulupu, The Coin* (short
for *The Coin* in the below paragraphs). New features and ideas will
first be developed and tested on *The Code*. The canary network
(testnet) is what the developers will be directly maintaining.

Once in a while, community members can fetch new features from *The
Code*, and apply them to *The Coin*. *The Coin* is considered a value
network, which means that it's a network that investors may speculate
and trade.

We do not plan to launch the canary network (testnet) *The Code*
just yet. It will likely happen in the coming months. Several notable
difference of *The Code* compared with *The Coin* are likely to happen
initially with further development of Kulupu.

* *The Code* will likely to be directly on PoW algorithm
  version 3. This is likely to be a GPU-friendly algorithm with
  imporved signed mining, using deterministic signatures. This will
  allow *The Code* to have shorter block time.
* *The Code* will likely to have better era support from the
  beginning, to better facilitate any possible ReGenesis process.
* *The Code* will likely to have a new difficulty adjustment logic, to
  better facilitate light clients. It will likely also use
  digest-based PoW-upgrading logic, rather than the current one based
  on runtime-extern.
* The canary network (testnet) community of *The Code* will be more
  likely to support unlimited total supply (and fixed emission) than
  *The Coin*.

*The Coin* is supposed to form a leaderless community from
now on. Network upgrades of *The Code* will continue to be maintained
by the development community. However, on *The Coin*, this is expected
to be a task that is *up for grab by the public*.

The development community will continue to facilitate tasks for *The
Coin* for things related to fact-checking and transparency. This
includes disclaimers, DYOR series posts, misinformation corrections,
and others.

== Miscellaneous

* The specification of Sedbin is updated to now require data
  availability. Without the data availability guarantee, Sedbin's fork
  choice will not function correctly.sidenote:thank-you[Thank you,
